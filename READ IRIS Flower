##Iris Flower Classification 

The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning project where the goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This is based on the measurements of four features:

1. Sepal Length


2. Sepal Width


3. Petal Length


4. Petal Width

This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can analyze data and make predictions. It is one of the most famous examples in the field of supervised learning.
